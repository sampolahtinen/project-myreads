# MyReads Project

This is a simple book shelf app that let's you keep track of your books. It let's you assign a bookshelf for your books. There are three different bookshelves called "Currently Reading", "Finished" and "Wishlist." Once user makes a selection, the book moves to the corresponding bookshelf. User can also search for new books by using the search field. Book search utilizes custom build API to find books from the server.
